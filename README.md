**DAZUD** collects bicycles in Austria and sends them to South Africa to create jobs and provide mobility to the impoverished. A technical team in South Africa repairs all the bicycles and distribute them locally. The majority are donated to those in need, while the remaining bicycles are completely restored (as new) and sold to more privileged customers. Additional funds are generated by selling a small collection of sustainable apparel online in Europe.

The project encouraged us to also start developing digital solutions, which could benefit the bike comminuty (or the sport community at large) and here a collection of all our opensource projects.

I am an absolute newbie at open source programming, so please feel free to give advice, or contribute...
